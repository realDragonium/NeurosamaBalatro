# Neuro-sama Balatro AI Integration

A comprehensive Balatro mod that integrates with the Neuro-sama SDK to enable autonomous AI gameplay. This mod allows the AI VTuber Neuro-sama to play Balatro independently while viewers watch, with seamless WebSocket communication and intelligent game state analysis.

## Features

### üîß **Mod Compatible**
- Dynamic card descriptions read from UI rendering (not hardcoded)
- Should work with any custom jokers/consumables from other mods

### ü§ù **Co-op Ready**
- Actions and context mirror real-time game state for multiple observers
- WebSocket API enables external tools and AI integration
- State-validated actions prevent desync issues
